The method described in the [AMIGo paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12122) listed below is implemented in [monobeast/minigrid/monobeast_amigo.py](./monobeast/minigrid/monobeast_amigo.py) of this repository. Please consult that file for details of the teacher and student policies, the losses used to train them, and other aspects of training. 

The student policy is created in `class MinigridNet`. The teacher policy is created in `class Generator`. The training loop is defined in `train()` and is divided into `act()` which collects the batches generated by the actors, and `learn()` which updates the learner based on `vtrace`. Training is based on the [TorchBeast](https://github.com/facebookresearch/torchbeast) implementation of IMPALA (Monobeast version).

If you have any questions or feel the code needs further clarification in the form of comments, please do not hesitate to [raise an issue](https://github.com/facebookresearch/adversarially-motivated-intrinsic-goals/issues/new).

# Installation

```bash
# create a new conda environment
conda create -n amigo python=3.7
conda activate amigo

# install dependencies
git clone git@github.com:facebookresearch/adversarially-motivated-intrinsic-goals.git
cd adversarially-motivated-intrinsic-goals
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Running Experiments

## Train AMIGo on MiniGrid

```bash
# Run AMIGo on MiniGrid Environment
OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 python -m monobeast.minigrid.monobeast_amigo --env MiniGrid-KeyCorridorS5R3-v0 \
--num_actors 40 --modify --generator_batch_size 150 --generator_entropy_cost .05 \
--generator_threshold -.5 --total_frames 600000000 \
--generator_reward_negative -.3 --disable_checkpoint \
--savedir ./experimentMinigrid
```
Please be sure to use --total_frames as in the paper: <br>
6e8 for KeyCorridorS4R3-v0, KeyCorridorS5R3-v0, ObstructedMaze-2Dlhb-v0, ObstructedMaze-1Q-v0 <br>
3e7 for KeyCorridorS3R3 and ObstructedMaze-1Dl-v0


## Train the baselines on MiniGrid
We used an open sourced [implementation](https://github.com/facebookresearch/impact-driven-exploration) of the exploration baselines (i.e. RIDE, RND, ICM, and Count). This code should be pulled in a separate local repository and run within a separate environment.

```bash
# create a new conda environment
conda create -n ride python=3.7
conda activate ride 

# install dependencies
git clone git@github.com:facebookresearch/impact-driven-exploration.git
cd impact-driven-exploration
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To reproduce the baseline results in the paper, run:
```bash
OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 python -m python main.py --env MiniGrid-ObstructedMaze-1Q-v0 \
--intrinsic_reward_coef 0.01 --entropy_cost 0.0001
```
with the corresponding best values for the `--intrinsic_reward_coef` and `--entropy_cost` reported in the paper for each model. 

Set `--model` to `ride`, `rnd`, `curiosity`, or `count` for RIDE, RND, ICM, or Count, respectively.

Set `--use_fullobs_policy` for using a full view of the environment as input to the policy network. 

Set `--use_fullobs_intrinsic` for using full views of the environment to compute the intrinsic reward. 

The default uses a partial view of the environment for both the policy and the intrinsic reward.
